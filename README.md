# BlankVim

This is just my personal config. At this point it has as much stuff as lazyvim or something.

Nothing special. I do try to keep the actual ui pretty minimal outside of the linenumbers and a bar. 

I'm using noice purely to get rid of the commmand line at the very bottom. Since noice lets you combine the statusbar and command line.

then the rest is just to make it as much of an ide like experience for writing bash, and c. 
I also have a lua lsp set up for neovim (although you still get useless diagnostics for some variables)

It's using vim.pack for the plugin manager. So this will only work if you are using neovim nightly, until they add vim.pack into stable neovim.

I've also enabled some of the plugins that come with neovim (at least in the git release), undotree, and a few others.
